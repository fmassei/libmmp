libmmp library

Introduction
------------------
libmmp is a little library, written in C, to wrap some system function 
between win32 and linux.

Right now it wraps:
- threads
- some synchronization objects (semaphores, events and mutexes for threads only)
- shared memory
- sockets (partially)
- dynamic module loading (.DLL and .SO)
- some string functions (like strncpy and similar) 

It also contains:
- TAP testing functions
- Error tracking
- Basic containers
- Nice list, stack, binary tree, B-tree implementation
- A simple hash table (implemented the K & R way) 
- An interessant B-array data-structure

Building libmmp
------------------
libmmp can be built under linux and windows with to separate project files;
in both of them there is a build profile for self-tap-testing the library
itself.
